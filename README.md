## Introduction

I have solved over 1850 problems and completed multiple projects, which have helped me enhance my skills, expand my knowledge, and prepare for technical interviews.

## How to Learn Programming the Right Way?

Don’t waste your time in the wrong places. Here's a summary of the steps you should follow:

---

### 1. Stay Away from Negative People
Negative people will discourage you about programming. They’ll say things like: “It’s hard, there’s no future in it, you’ll never find a job, salaries are low…” Never listen to those who have failed in this field; always seek advice from those who have succeeded.

### 2. Understand the Difference Between Programming and Programming Languages
Programming is about logic, analysis, and thinking to find solutions. A programming language is simply a tool to implement your logic and thinking. Focus on learning programming concepts rather than just learning languages. If you are good at programming, you can learn any programming language in less than a month.

---

### 3. Don’t Start with Modern Programming Languages
Modern programming languages come with many ready-made functions, methods, and tools that may distract you and prevent you from learning the logic behind programming.

**For example:** Students in grades 1 to 6 study basic math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, etc.). Why? Because they need to strengthen their logic and thinking. If you give them a calculator in grade 1, they won’t develop their logical thinking. Similarly, modern programming languages are useful, but you should start learning them after you have strengthened your logic and thinking, just as you can use a calculator at the right time.

### 4. Learn C++, Java, or Python
Pick one language and focus on learning the fundamentals. Start solving problems with it — aim to solve no less than 2000 problems.

Don’t read or learn anything else until you’ve completed 500-700 problems. After that, start learning about data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. At this stage, you will understand these concepts much more easily.

### 5. After Solving 2000 Problems (Which Will Take at Least a Year)
You’ll be ready to start learning a modern programming language, which will take about a month. Then, begin learning databases (any database will do), which will take 1-3 weeks.

---

### 6. Start Your First Project
I highly recommend starting with a desktop project, like a university registration system, which includes students, courses, doctors, lectures, exams, etc. Start simple, then gradually add more functionality.

---

### 7. After Completing All the Above Steps
You will be strong enough to learn anything and choose any technology or programming language you wish.

By following these steps, you’ll build a strong foundation and be ready to tackle any programming challenge that comes your way.
